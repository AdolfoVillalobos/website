In this first post I would like to introduce a bit of what the Blog will be about. 

It will be a blog in which I will share technical knowledge in different software and finance areas in which I have worked or just have an interest. I have been fortunate to work in several roles in the industry, all of them related to technology:

* `Data Scientist`
* `Data Engineer`
* `Software Engineer`
* `Algorithmic Trader`

I might also share some insights into some life experiences that I have had, and how they have shaped my career and my life.

I hope you enjoy the content that I will be sharing here.


```python
print("Hello World!")
```
